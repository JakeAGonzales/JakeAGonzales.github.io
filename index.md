## About me

I'm currently a  PhD student at the University of Washington where I am advised by [Prof. Behcet Acikmese](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese) and [Prof. Lillian Ratliff](https://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/). My research interests are broadly at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and optmization. I'm currently working on developing safe and scalable decision-making algorithms for multi-agent autonmous mobility. 

Previously, I got an undergrad degree in electrical engineering from the University of New Mexico. There, I worked in the [Human-Centered Systems and Control Lab](https://hscl.unm.edu) where I was advised by [Prof. Meeko Oishi](http://www.unm.edu/~oishi/). I did research in data-driven stochastic optimal control. 

I've also had internship experience at MIT Lincoln Labs and Sandia National Labs.
